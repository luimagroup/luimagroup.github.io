# Spring 2019 Course Website

**CMU**: Course number tba, 12 units  
**Pitt**: Law 5719, 3cr  

# Instructors
[Matthias Grabmair](http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/mgrabmai), Systems Scientist, CMU LTI  
[Kevin D. Ashley](https://www.law.pitt.edu/people/kevin-d-ashley), Professor of Law and Intelligence Systems, University of Pittsburgh

# Course Abstract
Technological advances are affecting the legal profession. While it is hard to predict the changes that machine learning and natural language processing will bring, legal professionals certainly will need to understand the new techniques and how to use and evaluate them. This joint course, co-taught by instructors from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law and Carnegie Mellon University’s Language Technologies Institute, provides a hands-on practical introduction to the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing as they are being applied to support the work of legal professionals, researchers, and administrators. Researchers in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Law (AI&Law) have been applying recent advances in natural language processing and machine learning to extract semantic information from legal documents and to use it to solve legal problems. Meanwhile, the commercial LegalTech sector is thriving. Companies and startups have been tapping into the legal industry’s need to make large-scale document analysis tasks more efficient, and to use predictive analytics for better decision making. This course will help law students gain literacy with these technologies and learn how to apply them to the kinds of legal problems they have studied or will encounter in practice. This course not only teaches law students about the new tools, but enables students to gain practical experience using them under close mentorship and in project-based collaboration with students from computer science backgrounds who want to learn about the law.

# Course Topics
The course will cover the following topical progression:  

* **Python Programming Tutorial**
* **Introduction to Artificial Intelligence & Law**, including formal rule- & case-based reasoning, and computational models of argumentation
* **Basics of Machine Learning**
* **Analysis and Prediction using the Supreme Court Database**
* **Fair Machine Learning under Nondiscrimination Imperatives**
* **Basics of Natural Language Processing**
* **Legal Text Analytics** including annotation, rule-based & ML-based text processing, and information retrieval
* **Legal Topics Related to AI** most likely including Statistical Argumentation in Courts, Legal Liability of Autonomous Vehicles, and Personal Care Robotics

# Learning Outcomes
After completing this course, and depending on students’ focus in the course project, they will have gained:

* an understanding of knowledge representation and argumentation formalisms used in AI&Law
* an understanding of and practice with basic techniques in applied machine learning
* practical experience in the development and assessment of research hypotheses in legal AI
* practical experience in design, planning and critical evaluation of legal AI project work
* basic knowledge in legal issues arising in the context of AI technology

# Course Format & Project Requirement
The course will be a mixture of lectures and guided programming workshops using iPython notebooks. There will be weekly reading with short abstract hand-in requirements. In the latter third of the semester students will form mixed teams of "lawyers" and "engineers" and propose a final project on legal data analysis which they will work on collaboratively. The course ends with project presentations, a public poster session, and a final report. There will be no midterm or final exam.

# Student Audience and Prerequisites
* University of Pittsburgh School of Law second and third year students with either prior experience in programming with the Python language or are willing to learn it in the first weeks of the semester. Experience in basic probability and statistics will also be beneficial.
* Carnegie Mellon University undergraduate students (juniors and seniors) with a pre-law major or course record with programming proficiency or willingness to lear it, and graduate students in technical disciplines with a strong interest in learning about the law, legal reasoning, and challenges in applying data science and AI methods to legal data
* If you are interested in taking the course and are unsure whether you are eligible or are sufficiently prepared, please contact the instructors
