The LUIMA group is a collaborative research initiative dedicated to the application of techniques from artificial intelligence, machine learning and natural language processing to legal data. The goal of our work is to facilitate research, development, and education for stakeholders, practitioners, and students from both legal and technical backgrounds.
Activities by LUIMA team members include:

   * Research on legal case-based reasoning with policies and values
   * Research on natural language processing of legal text, such as semantic information retrieval, analysis of statutory text, legal document segmentation, and entity detection
   * Research on argumentation and reasoning patterns in specialized jurisdictions (veterans claims appeals, medical malpractice, vaccine injuries)
   * Organization of the ASAIL workshop series on extraction of semantic information in legal text (San Diego 2015, London 2017)
   * Half-day conference tutorials on Artificial Intelligence and Law: Jurix 2011, ICAIL 2013, ICAIL 2015, ICAIL 2017
   * Book: Artificial Intelligence and Legal Analytics by Kevin Ashley
